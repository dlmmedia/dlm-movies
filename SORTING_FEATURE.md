# Sorting and Filtering Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive sorting and filtering capabilities to all curated movie list pages, allowing users to organize movies by year, title, popularity, rating, and language.

## New Features

### 1. **Sort Options**
Users can now sort movies by:
- **Default Order** - Original curated order
- **Newest First** - Sort by release year (descending)
- **Oldest First** - Sort by release year (ascending)
- **Title (A-Z)** - Alphabetical order
- **Most Popular** - By popularity score from TMDB
- **Highest Rated** - By user rating/vote average

### 2. **Language Filter**
- Automatically detects all languages present in the movie list
- Allows filtering by original language
- Displays friendly language names (e.g., "English" instead of "en")
- Shows "All Languages" option to reset filter

### 3. **Movie Count Display**
- Shows number of filtered movies vs total movies
- Updates dynamically as filters are applied

## Files Created

### `components/SortableMovieGrid.tsx`
A new client-side component that handles:
- Movie sorting logic
- Language filtering
- Dynamic UI updates
- Responsive design

## Files Modified

All curated list pages have been updated to use the new `SortableMovieGrid` component:

1. `/app/curated/christmas/page.tsx`
2. `/app/curated/entrepreneurs/page.tsx`
3. `/app/curated/students/page.tsx`
4. `/app/curated/romance/page.tsx`
5. `/app/curated/horror/page.tsx`
6. `/app/curated/inspirational/page.tsx`
7. `/app/curated/family-fun/page.tsx`
8. `/app/curated/action-packed/page.tsx`
9. `/app/curated/award-winners/page.tsx`
10. `/app/curated/sci-fi/page.tsx`

## Technical Implementation

### Client-Side Rendering
- Uses `'use client'` directive for interactivity
- State managed with React `useState` hooks
- Performance optimized with `useMemo` for sorting/filtering

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly dropdown controls
- Flexbox layout that adapts to screen size
- Consistent styling with existing design system

### Data Handling
- Preserves original movie order when "Default Order" is selected
- Handles missing data gracefully (e.g., movies without release dates)
- Uses TMDB popularity and vote_average fields for sorting

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- Clean, intuitive controls above movie grid
- Smooth transitions with Tailwind CSS
- Clear labeling of all options
- Movie count updates in real-time

### Accessibility
- Proper label associations for form controls
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigable dropdowns

## Usage Example

```tsx
// In any curated list page
import SortableMovieGrid from '@/components/SortableMovieGrid';

export default async function MyMoviesPage() {
  const movies = await tmdb.getMoviesByIds(movieIds);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Movie Collection</h1>
      <SortableMovieGrid movies={movies} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Genre filtering
- Decade filtering (1980s, 1990s, etc.)
- Multiple language selection
- Search within list
- Save user preferences (remember last sort option)
- Export list functionality
- Share filtered lists
