## 🎯 What Remains

The only external references that remain are:
- ✅ `image.tmdb.org` in `next.config.ts` (required for image CDN)
- ✅ API calls to TMDB endpoints (backend only, not visible to users)
- ✅ Environment variables for API keys (internal configuration)

These are technical necessities and are not visible in the user interface or public documentation.

## ✨ Result

DLM Movies now appears as a completely independent, self-branded movie discovery platform with no visible third-party attributions or technology stack references.

**Status: Complete** ✅
